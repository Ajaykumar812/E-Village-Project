<p>
    Survey data refers to information collected from a group of individuals or entities through a structured set of questions or inquiries. This data can be collected for various purposes, including market research, social studies, academic research, or business assessments. Survey data can be quantitative (numeric) or qualitative (textual) and may come from various sources such as online surveys, phone interviews, paper questionnaires, or in-person interviews.

   <br /> Analyzing survey data involves cleaning, organizing, and interpreting the collected responses to extract meaningful insights and trends. Researchers often use statistical tools and software to process and analyze survey data to draw conclusions, make decisions, or address research questions.
